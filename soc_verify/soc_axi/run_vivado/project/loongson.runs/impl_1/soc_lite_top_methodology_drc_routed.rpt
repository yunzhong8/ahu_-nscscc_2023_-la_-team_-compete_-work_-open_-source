2. REPORT DETAILS

SYNTH-5#1 Warning
Mapped onto distributed RAM because of timing constraints  
The instance u_cpu/mycpu_cache_item/temp_dcache_item/cache_table_item/cache_way_item0/d_reg_reg_0_127_0_0 is implemented as distributed LUT RAM for the following reason: The timing constraints suggest that the chosen mapping will yield a better timing.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-5#2 Warning
Mapped onto distributed RAM because of timing constraints  
The instance u_cpu/mycpu_cache_item/temp_dcache_item/cache_table_item/cache_way_item0/d_reg_reg_128_255_0_0 is implemented as distributed LUT RAM for the following reason: The timing constraints suggest that the chosen mapping will yield a better timing.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-5#3 Warning
Mapped onto distributed RAM because of timing constraints  
The instance u_cpu/mycpu_cache_item/temp_dcache_item/cache_table_item/cache_way_item1/d_reg_reg_0_127_0_0 is implemented as distributed LUT RAM for the following reason: The timing constraints suggest that the chosen mapping will yield a better timing.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-5#4 Warning
Mapped onto distributed RAM because of timing constraints  
The instance u_cpu/mycpu_cache_item/temp_dcache_item/cache_table_item/cache_way_item1/d_reg_reg_128_255_0_0 is implemented as distributed LUT RAM for the following reason: The timing constraints suggest that the chosen mapping will yield a better timing.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-10#1 Warning
Missing property on synchronizer  
One or more logic synchronizer has been detected between 2 clock domains but the synchronizer does not have the property ASYNC_REG defined on one or both registers. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-47#1 Warning
False path or asynchronous clock group between synchronous clocks  
A False Path timing constraint is set between synchronous clocks cpu_clk_clk_pll and timer_clk_clk_pll (see constraint position 5 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is not recommended to cover synchronous clock domains with constraints that prevent timing analysis as the design could fail in hardware.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-47#2 Warning
False path or asynchronous clock group between synchronous clocks  
A False Path timing constraint is set between synchronous clocks timer_clk_clk_pll and cpu_clk_clk_pll (see constraint position 4 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is not recommended to cover synchronous clock domains with constraints that prevent timing analysis as the design could fail in hardware.
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 10.000 -name clk -waveform {0.000 5.000} [get_ports clk] (Source: /home/sun/Vivado2019/nscscc/func-submit/soc_verify/soc_axi/run_vivado/constraints/soc_lite_top.xdc (Line: 5))

Related violations: <none>

XDCC-7#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten on the same source  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint defined on the same source. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 10.000 -name clk -waveform {0.000 5.000} [get_ports clk] (Source: /home/sun/Vivado2019/nscscc/func-submit/soc_verify/soc_axi/run_vivado/constraints/soc_lite_top.xdc (Line: 5))
